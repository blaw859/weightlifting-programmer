# weightlifting-programmer
tool to generate weightlifting programs, to start a way to store information

## Ideas/TODO
- How to differentiate between a Users program vs what they have actually done.
	- Maybe a tracker of how well you adhered to the program?
- XLS is a ubiquitous format for stuff like this, is storing in excel spreadsheets a good idea, maybe better as just another format.
